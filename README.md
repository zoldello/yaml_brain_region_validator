# YAML Validator

This is a proof of concept to validates a YAML file. To try this code out do -

- Go to the directory of the code
- do `cd YAML_Validation`
- run: `python cli.py ./sample.yml`
  
  You will get a message saying if the file is valid or not. You can replace `./sample.yml` with a different YAML file of your choice
